Tile Engine Design Document

This documents details the basic requirements for a general purpose and
lightweight tile engine. The target architecture is the libretro API with 
priority for Wii, 3DS, and eventually PSP compatibility.

The system is intended for simplicity of design and high performance. It is to
be written from a low-level perspective, compiled from C code, with minimal
dependencies. A firm toolset has not been defined at this point, and solutions
must be implemented for tileset and palette formatting as well as sound.

Specifications

All color is 16 bit ARGB (1,5,5,5).

The data format for graphics files is as follows:

 File Header "GFX\n"	- 32 bits 
 Pixel bitdepth		- 8 bits //log2(palette size)
 Padding                - 4 bits
 Palette qty		- 4 bits
 Palette data 0 	- (Palette size * 16)
 ---
 Palette data (N-1)	- (Palette size * 16)
 Tile size		- 8 bits
 Padding                - 4 bits
 Tile qty		- 12 bits
 Tile data 0		- (Tile size * Tile size * Pixel bitdepth )
 ---
 Tile data x		- (Tile size * Tile size * Pixel bitdepth )


The rendering system consists of two background layers (BG0 and BG1) and two
sprite layers (SP0 and SP1) which are rendered to a viewport. The size of each
of these layers is 512x320 and the viewport is 320x240 by default, although
support for 256x224, 240x160, 400x240, and 480x272 is also planned.

Rendering order is, from back to front: BG0, BG1, SP0, SP1.

The SP0 layer is the 16x16 sprite layer (main sprite layer).
The SP1 layer is the 8x8 sprite layer (bullet and score layer).

The BG0 and BG1 layers use 64 color palettes. The SP0 layer has 8 palettes with
15 colors each, and the SP1 layer has 16 palettes with 8 colors each. Palette
index 0 is fully transparent for all layers except for BG0, for which it is used
as final background color.

For background layers, which use 8 bits per pixel, each graphics tile uses
2048 bits or 256 bytes. A 320x240 viewport full of non-redundant graphics uses
20x15=300 tiles which requires 76800 bytes or 75 kilo bytes. A full layer of
size 512x320 has 640 tiles, which requires 160 kilo bytes.
