This documents details the basic requirements for a general purpose and lightweight tile engine. The target architecture is the libretro API with priority for Wii, 3DS, and eventually PSP compatibility.

The system is intended for simplicity of design and high performance. It is to be written from a low-level perspective, compiled from C code, with minimal dependencies. A firm toolset has not been defined at this point, and solutions must be implemented for tileset and palette formatting as well as sound.
