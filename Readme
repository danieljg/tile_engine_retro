This documents details the basic requirements for a general purpose and
lightweight tile engine. The target architecture is the libretro API with 
priority for Wii, 3DS, and eventually PSP compatibility.

The system is intended for simplicity of design and high performance. It is to
be written from a low-level perspective, compiled from C code, with minimal
dependencies. A firm toolset has not been defined at this point, and solutions
must be implemented for tileset and palette formatting as well as sound.

Specifications

All color is 16 bit ARGB (1,5,5,5).

The data format is as follows:

 Palette size		- 8 bits
 Padding                - 4 bits
 Palette qty		- 4 bits
 Palette data 0 	- (Palette size * 16)
 ---
 Palette data (N-1)	- (Palette size * 16)
 Tile size		- 8 bits
 Tile qty		- 12 bits
 Tile data 0		- (Tile size * Tile size * Palette size)
 ---
 Tile data x		- (Tile size * Tile size * Palette size)
